                            Christy Barritt writes contemporary mystery and suspense novels.  Some lean more towards humor, while others have only occasional bits of comic relief.  If you enjoy humorous mysteries with mild suspense, you could read her Squeaky Clean mystery series; if you enjoy the suspense, you could read her Fog Lake series, or any of the Lantern Beach series (mentioned below).

                            Mary Connealy writes humorous western romances set primarily in the mid- to late- 1860s.  Her books are lighthearted and fun - great for when you are down and need a good laugh.  She does have a contemporary series that leans mostly towards suspense, but even those books have a fair deal of humor built in.

                            Karen Witemeyer writes romances set in 1880s Texas.  While not as funny as Connealy's books, they are still sweet and readers are drawn into the plights of the characters.  You can visit her webpage <a href="http://www.karenwitemeyer.com" target="_blank">here</a>.

                            Irene Hannon writes romantic suspense.  I enjoy her books because they are predictable and you get to know her characters well.  You also usually get to know a little of the villian's perspective for why things are being done.  Frequently, the villian is a broken person who feels there is no other recourse.

                            This is actually a series of series written by Christy Barritt.  It started when a cop from the west coast moved to Lantern Beach, a small island off the coast of North Carolina in an unofficial witness protection program.  It contains several series where the story continues to build throughout the series and a couple of series of standalone novels.

                            This series is written by Elizabeth Peters (a pseudonym used by Barbara Mertz). Amelia Peabody is a self-proclaimed detective who solves mysteries (mostly murder mysteries) during the archaeology season in Egypt, with an occasional mystery in England.  The series begins around 1880 and runs through WWI.  As the series progresses, her entire family becomes involved in solving the mysteries.

                            Jana DeLeon writes this series about a CIA operative, Fortune, with a bounty on her head.  Because of the bounty, Fortune's boss sends her to Sinful, Louisiana to hide out where she eventually becomes a private investigator.  There, she encounters a couple characters who are described as "old as Moses", and hilarity ensues.  Each book has a mystery (usually a murder) to solve, and is full of humor as the three investigators work to solve the crime and not get mixed up with the deputy.

                            The O'Malley series, written by Dee Henderson, is a romantic suspense series focusing on a self-formed family who met in an orphanage in Chicago.  Each book is a standalone focusing on a different member of the family, but there are a few over arching pieces which makes it best to read the series in order.  This series highlights Henderson's ability to write in such a manner that readers truly feel they get to know the characters and feel the emotions felt with their struggles and triumphs.
